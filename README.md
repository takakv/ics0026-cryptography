# ICS0026 Cryptography

Introduction to cryptography for the Cyber Security Engineering bachelor's programme students at Tallinn University of Technology.

The course aims to give a high level overview of the major cryptographic primitives and their use cases.
The course is not a formal (or mathematical) study of primitives, their implementations or security definitions.
Rather, students learn about what tools are available and for which purpose.
Students are encouraged to appreciate the ‘unknown unknowns’ of cryptography and warned about the danger of designing or implementing algorithms and protocols.

The slides are not self-contained and serve merely as a reminder on discussed topics.
For formal notions and definitions, see the suggested course literature.
