\begin{task}{PKCS v1.5 vs. PSS}
  \textit{Preface.}
  OpenSSL signatures can be generated either with the \texttt{dgst} tool or with the \texttt{pkeyutl} tool.
  The exception is Ed25519, for which you must use the \texttt{pkeyutl} tool.

  \textit{Task.}
  For this task, generate two RSA signatures in PKCS v1.5 mode on the same message, and compare the two signatures.
  Next, generate two signatures on the same message in PSS mode and compare the signatures.
  Make sure to use PSS with an appropriate hash algorithm---i.e. not the SHA1 default---for both hashing the message and for MGF1.
  Use your preferred OpenSSL tool to do so.
  
  Do your observations correspond with what we learnt in class?

  Then, look at the \texttt{genpkey} documentation.
  Are you able to \enquote{lock} the RSA key to good PSS parameters?
  What happens if you try to sign using RSA-PSS with parameters that do not correspond to parameters specified for the key?
\end{task}

\begin{task}{RSA implementations}
  \textit{Task.}
  Check out \href{https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-1494}{CVE-2016-1494} which is about using the \href{https://www.darkreading.com/cyberattacks-data-breaches/-berserk-bug-uncovered-in-mozilla-nss-crypto-library-impacts-firefox-chrome}{\textit{BERserk}} attack against the \href{https://github.com/sybrenstuvel/python-rsa}{\texttt{rsa}} Python library to forge signatures.
  If you are interested, you can read more about it in the corresponding \href{https://words.filippo.io/bleichenbacher-06-signature-forgery-in-python-rsa/}{\textit{blog post}}.

  In class, I mentioned that RSA PKCS v1.5 signatures have no known weaknesses.
  So how come this attack exists?\footnote{The attack is feasible because of an implementation error, not a crypto-theoretical error.
  Nevertheless, it highlights why you should prefer PSS padding.} 

  Search to see whether PyCryptodome has had any RSA-related vulnerabilities reported in the past.

  \begin{tcolorbox}[title=Warning]
    Even though the BERserk vulnerability is Python-RSA is now \href{https://github.com/sybrenstuvel/python-rsa/commit/ab5d21c3b554f926d51ff3ad9c794bcf32e95b3c}{\textit{fixed}}, there are still other issues with it such as side-channel vulnerabilities\footnote{\url{https://github.com/sybrenstuvel/python-rsa/issues/169}}\footnote{\url{https://github.com/sybrenstuvel/python-rsa/issues/165}} caused by it being a pure-python implementation.
    It also does not support PKCS \#1 v2.0 and later.
    \tcblower
    Do not use Python-RSA if alternatives are available.
    In general, do not use pure-python crypto implementations.

\begin{task}{Meet your peers}
  \textit{Preface.}
  Generating and verifying signatures for keys you have generated on your own becomes boring really fast.
  In the real world, usually someone else verifies your signature, or you have to verify someone else's signature.

  The EdDSA signature algorithm offers two \enquote{modes}\footnotemark{} for signing data:
  \footnotetext{These modes are not comparable with block cipher modes.}%
  \begin{itemize}
    \item PureEdDSA (Ed25519, Ed448): the message is fed to the signing algorithm directly.
    \item HashEdDSA (Ed25519ph, Ed448ph): the message is pre-hashed and the hash is fed to the signing algorithm.
    
    This has some advantages (e.g. for memory constrained devices) but also disadvantages, such as reduced collision resistance.
  \end{itemize}
  You should always use PureEdDSA over HashEdDSA unless you have a very good reason to use the latter.

  \textit{Task.}
  Using \href{https://pycryptodome.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/signature/eddsa.html}{\texttt{pycryptodome}}, generate an Ed448 keypair.
  Exchange your public key and a signed message (you can try to cheat) with your neighbour or another classmate of your choice.
  Finally, verify their signature on their message.
  Did they give you the correct message/signature?
\end{task}

\begin{task}{SPHINCS\textsuperscript{+}}
  \textit{Preface.}
  SPHINCS\textsuperscript{+} is one of the three post-quantum signature algorithms that NIST has standardised as part of the move towards PQC.
  It is the only hash-based one of the three, with the other two being based on lattices.
  The standardised signature algorithm based on SPHINCS\textsuperscript{+} is called \enquote{SHL-DSA} and is standardised in \href{https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/205/final}{FIPS 205}.

  SPHINCS\textsuperscript{+} is divided into three schemes:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item SPHINCS\textsuperscript{+}-SHAKE256
    \item SPHINCS\textsuperscript{+}-SHA-256
    \item SPHINCS\textsuperscript{+}-Haraka
  \end{itemize}
  which differ in the hash function the scheme is instantiated with.

  Furthermore, the schemes are split into the \texttt{f} and \texttt{s} versions, which can roughly be summarised as:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{f}: fast signing but large signatures,
    \item \texttt{s}: smaller signatures, but slower signing.
  \end{itemize}

  Finally, SPHINCS\textsuperscript{+} offers three different security levels:
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{@{}l r r r r@{}}
      \toprule
      Algorithm & bits of security & $\PK$ bytes & $\SK$ bytes & $\sigma$ bytes\\
      \midrule
      \texttt{SPHINCS\textsuperscript{+}-128s} & 133 & 32 &  64 &  7 856\\
      \texttt{SPHINCS\textsuperscript{+}-128f} & 128 & 32 &  64 & 17 088\\
      \texttt{SPHINCS\textsuperscript{+}-192s} & 193 & 48 &  96 & 16 224\\
      \texttt{SPHINCS\textsuperscript{+}-192f} & 194 & 48 &  96 & 35 664\\
      \texttt{SPHINCS\textsuperscript{+}-256s} & 255 & 64 & 128 & 29 792\\
      \texttt{SPHINCS\textsuperscript{+}-256f} & 255 & 64 & 128 & 49 856\\
      \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
  These values are taken from the reference implementation's GitHub \href{https://github.com/sphincs/sphincsplus}{\textit{repo}}.
  A nice article (nice tables) on the parameter sets and performance is ePrint \href{https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/1725}{\texttt{2022/1725}}.

  The \enquote{official} SPHINCS\textsuperscript{+} signature library is provided by the Python module \href{https://github.com/sphincs/pyspx}{\texttt{pyspx}}.
  That is, it provides bindings to the reference C implementation of SPHINCS\textsuperscript{+}.

  \textit{Task.}
  For this task, generate a \texttt{SPHINCS\textsuperscript{+}-128f} signature with the SHAKE256 hash algorithm.
  How long did signing take?

  Then, generate a signature with the \texttt{s} version.
  How long did signing take now?

  Next, benchmark the time needed to generate $1000$ signatures with the \texttt{f} version.
  Compare this time with the time it takes for you to generate $1000$ Ed25519 signatures.
  How could you make the comparison \enquote{fairer}?
\end{task}

\begin{task}{Forging a textbook RSA signature}
  Using textbook RSA, can you create some valid (message, signature) pair without access to the RSA secret key?
  Note that the message does not get hashed.

  Can you forge a signature for a meaningful message if you have access to a signing oracle?
  Once more, assume that the messages do not get hashed.
\end{task}

\begin{task}{EdDSA with OpenSSL}
  \textit{Preface.}
  At this point, you should have some familiarity with OpenSSL.
  The \href{https://www.openssl.org/docs/man3.0/man1/openssl-dgst.html}{\texttt{dgst}} tool is typically used for signing (with pre-hashing) and for verifying signatures.
  However, the \texttt{dgst} tool does not support EdDSA signing.
  Instead, you should use the \href{https://www.openssl.org/docs/man3.0/man1/openssl-pkeyutl.html}{\texttt{pkeyutl}} tool.

  \textit{Task.}
  For this task, familiarise yourself with the OpenSSL documentation.
  Then, generate an Ed25519 keypair with OpenSSL and try to sign and verify a signature from the command line.

  Verify the signature with some other tool (e.g. in Python).
  Did OpenSSL use PureEdDSA?

  This task is cursed and will prove to you that OpenSSL (and especially its documentation) is horrible.
  This task will likely be part of the homework as well ;).
